**Experiment 1: Hello World Program**

**Title of the Experiment:**
Understanding the Basic Structure of a C++ Program (Hello World)

**Objective / Aim:**
To study and implement the basic structure of a C++ program and display a simple message using `cout`.

**Tools and Software Used:**

* Code::Blocks IDE or Visual Studio Code
* GCC Compiler (MinGW or g++)
* Operating System: Windows 10 or Linux

**Theory:**
C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language. Every C++ program has a basic structure that includes header files, the `main()` function, and output statements.
The Hello World program is often the first step in learning any programming language.
This program demonstrates:

* Inclusion of the header file `#include <iostream>`
* Use of `using namespace std;`
* Output using `cout`
* Returning control using `return 0;`

**Algorithm:**

1. Start the program
2. Include the necessary header file
3. Define the `main()` function
4. Use the `cout` statement to display “Hello, World!”
5. Return 0 to indicate successful execution
6. End the program

**Flowchart (Text Description):**
Start → Display Message → End

**Conclusion:**
The Hello World program compiled and ran successfully.
This experiment helped understand the fundamental structure and syntax of a C++ program.

## Experiment 2: Simple Calculator Program

**Title of the Experiment:**
Creating a Simple Calculator using C++

**Aim:**
To implement a C++ program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Tools Used:**
* Code::Blocks or Visual Studio Code
* GCC Compiler (MinGW or g++)
* Operating System: Windows 10 or Linux

**Theory:**
A simple calculator program helps understand user input, arithmetic operators, and conditional statements in C++.
 The user inputs two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, \*, /).
* Conditional logic (if, else if, or switch) determines the operation.
* The result is calculated and displayed.

**Concepts Introduced:**
* Data types: `int`, `float`
* Input and output: `cin`, `cout`
* Control flow: `if-else`
* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

**Algorithm:**
1.  Start the program
2.  Input two numbers from the user
3.  Ask the user to choose an arithmetic operator
4.  Use conditional statements to perform the operation
5.  Display the result
6.  End the program

**Flowchart (Text Description):**
Start → Input num1, num2 → Input operator → Perform operation → Display result → End

**Sample Outputs:**
* If user inputs 5, 3, and + → Output: 8
* If user inputs 10, 2, and / → Output: 5

**Conclusion:**
The calculator program executed successfully for all four basic operations.

This experiment helped in understanding arithmetic computation, conditional logic, and user interaction in C++.
